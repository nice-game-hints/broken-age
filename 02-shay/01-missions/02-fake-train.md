A horrible train wreck is going to happen!

# What to do?
Wake up the mountain by yelling at it.

# We are saved!
Yes you are. But what if you would like to do something else, for a change?

# Crash the train
You should crash the train, yes.

# How?
Wake up the mountain. Just before the train hits the bridge, yell again to the mountain so it removes the bridge.
