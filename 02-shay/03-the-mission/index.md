title: The rescue mission
---

Marek gives you a very cool rescue mission. Talk with him covering all points to get the Omicron Inhibitor and Star Chart to Prima Doom.

He says you have to:
 - [Manually override the boom controls](010-boom-control.md)
 - [Manually control the shields](030-fusion-orb.md)
 - [Navigate the ship to Prima Doom](050-prima-doom.md)

# I did all of those
Great! Go talk to Marek. Save the creatures!
