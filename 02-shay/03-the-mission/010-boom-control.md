One important part of the mission is to get access to the manual boom controls.
The boom controls should be accessed _outside_ of the space ship. You can go through the airlock.

# Airlock
When you enter the airlock you are in space. [You just have to get up](020-space/index.md)

# I'm free!
Guide yourself (by clicking) to the boom control. It is in the far left and you have to go over the spiky tower.

# Boom controls
It is sealed with a hatch. Can you pry it open[^1]?

[^1]: Use the knife from the kitchen to the hatch.

# It is open
Now, you would need to remote control the controls somehow.

# With what?
Take Grabbing Gary from your inventory and let it grab the controls. You can now control the booms with Grabbing Gary's controller.
