The arm is preventing, protecting, you from freely moving in space. You should have propulsion.

# Propulsion?
Something that will spruit stuff out would make a good propulsor.

# Like what?
Check out the avalanche mission.

# Checking
Grab the whipping cream gun from the avalanche mission room. Attach it to your space suit to escape the arm.
