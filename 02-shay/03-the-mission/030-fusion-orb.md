The middle teleporter will get you to the Fusion Orb Containment Facility.

# Can't get in
You need [a helmet](140-helmet/index.md) because of the radiation. Get to the facility and [put the helmet on with the suit](140-helmet/fit.md).

# I have the helmet on
Great! Now you can walk (in to the door, and down) to the Fusion Orb. Now you can inhibit the Orb with the Omicron Inhibitor.
