Alex needs an _electric genius_ to work on his space ship.

# Who or what is that?
Indeed, _what_ is it? Have you checked the beach?

# Beach?
There is an abandoned hexipal buddy laying on the beach. Where the maidens used to be.

# I have the hexipal buddy
Offer it to Alex

# It doesn't work
Maybe you need to rewire it. Find some [wire](070-wire.md) first.

# I have the wire
Right. Then just combine the wire with the hexipal buddy and make it alive again.

# Any hints?
[broken link](vella.md) Have you played with Vella? She is now in the ship where the Hexipal buddy originated.
