You have the sand model of [Superconducting Gyroscopic Hypercam](030-superconducting.md). It just needs to be firmer.

# Firmer
Do you remember? What made the sand tougher last time?

# Sap!
Correct. Maybe the tree would give you more sap.

# How?
What Vella did to it was surely awful and it will remember.

# How to remind it?
Show it the picture of Vella ^[Check out Curtis' mailbox for the flyer about Vella] to make it vomit.

# Sap!
Oh yeah, and put the mold in the ground first and _then_ show the picture.
