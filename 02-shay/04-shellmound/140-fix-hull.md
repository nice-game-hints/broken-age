Your dad is mixing the mixture that can be used to fix the hull. It's pH is off before adding the final ingredient.

# How much off?
You could check the pH with a tool. Something that know what you _were_ eating.

# What tool?
Dip you spoon into the mixture. It will tell you the pH.

# It is way too high
Ask your dad how to lower the pH.

# Acidial
You know, the peach ^[You find one from the bottom of the peach tree. Just ask Gus to give you one.] is just that.

# I have a peach
Put some peach into the Hull Patch to lower its pH. Check the pH with the spoon.

# The pH
Applying peach into it lowered the pH by two from 14 to 12. Just put some peach juice into it until you have lowered it enough.

# But..
Oh, you can't get to seven, right. First, lower the mixture to pH of 6 with the peach juice.

# It is now
Now you need to raise the pH just by one. Ask your dad how.

# Calcium carbonate?
[Get some calcium carbonate](150-calcium-carbonate.md)

# I have some
Great, put the egg shells into the hull patch. Check the pH.

# Not right yet
You just have to apply some peach juice (-2 pH) and egg shells (+3 pH) multiple times to get it to 7 pH. Check with the spoon.
