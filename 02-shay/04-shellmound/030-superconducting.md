Alex needs a Superconducting Gyroscopic Hypercam to get the ship working. Talk to him and he will give you the blueprint for it.

# Who would build it?
Have you talked to Curtis?

# Yes
He is into metalworking now. Maybe he could help you. Show him the blueprint.

# He only works for molds
Molds, you say? If someone could build you the model or prototype first.

# Who?
I would say sand is the best material here to build a mold.

# Sand?
[Feast Master Dune](020-feast-master.md) is great with sand. Show him the blueprint and say that sand is the perfect material.

# I have the model
Yes, unfortunately it is not superconductive. Maybe it is just a mold. Show it to Curtis.

# It's not a mold
Mold should be tougher.

# Tougher?
It is made of sand. [Make the sand mold tougher.](035-hardening-mold.md)

# It is ready!
Get it to Curtis and you get the Superconducting Gyroscopic Hypercam. If Curtis does not accept your mold talk to him first about his current wizard mold. Show the final product to Alex.
