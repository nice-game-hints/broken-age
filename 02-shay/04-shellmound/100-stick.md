You would need a stick. It is handy if you need to fight, for example.

# Stick?
Didn't Granpa and the kid have some kind of stick fight going on in Meriloft? Next to the hatch?

# They do!
Did you talk to them?

# I did...
I think the key to this puzzle isÂ [a cupcake](090-cupcake.md).

# I have a cupcake!
Granpa could frost it.

# But it has frost on it
Someone could eat the frost away.

# Who?
Walter only eats frost from cupcakes. Give the cupcake to Walter. He is at the Cloud Shoes shop.

# He ate the frosting
Now show the cupcake to Granpa. He will give you his cane. It works for fighting, too.
