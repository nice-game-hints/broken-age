Lightbeard is stuck in his cloud. You have to help him. Or help F'thr to help him.

# How?
Did you try to climb up there?

# It goes down
Yes. While you keep the ladder (and the cloud) down F'thr could do the heroic deed.

# He is afraid
Ask him to untie the knot. That's the least he could do. [With F'thr you can untie the knot](050-knot/index.md) and help Lightbeard.
