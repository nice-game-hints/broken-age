The tree would like to hear a good joke.

# A good joke?
Avoid any _tree-offensive_ topics.

# Okay
And try to land a perfect punchline. 

# That's all?
Yes, by finding the correct combination the fish will fall. Just keep trying, it has all the time in the world to listen. But it is a though crowd.

# Little help?
At least these starting lines dont work

> Do you know why penguins don't have Christmas trees?
> What did the stump say to the axe?
> How many lumberjacks does it need to change a lightbulb?


# Naturally...
But here are some combinations that should work! The jokes change every time you try so keep telling them until you get a good start.

> Did you hear about First National Tree Bank?
> It closed down.
> Don't worry. It just started a new branch.

> What's the smallest full-grown tree you ever head of?
> I've seen one no bigger than my hand.
> A palm tree.
