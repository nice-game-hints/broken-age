You need wire for... wiring purposes!

# Where?
Carol has started a new business. She will fish with fish hooks she makes herself, from wire.

# It's not working
If you could give her an actual hook she would give you the wire.

# Actual hook?
Didn't you have one with you? Give her the knitting hook.

# She doesn't believe it works
You have to proof that the hook catches fish.
Try to find [a fish](060-fish.md), first.

# I have the fish
Now, show the fish to Carol. She is impressed by it.

# My secret
Then, give her the hook. She gives you the wire.
