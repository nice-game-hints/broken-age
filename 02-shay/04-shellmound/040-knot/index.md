When you get Brother Lightbeard's cloud down the next thing is to ask F'thr to untie the bow.
Give him any _good_ reason to help you (not the fraudster one).

# Hard knot!
It is! And F'ther only makes it messier!

# We need help
That is correct. You need a knot expert!

# Who is that?
Someone who is good with her hands.

# Who is it?
Carol, go talk to Carol about the knots. You have to know what the knot looks like so try it first with F'thr. Try to describe the knot you left behind well.

# Talked with her
You need a Writing utencil... like a pen?

# A pencil?
Alex has a pencil. Go talk to him and ask for the pencil. Give it to Carol.

# A diagram!
Great, now, just go back to the ladder and shout the instructions on the diagram to F'thr.

# I can't do it
First, did you describe the knot correctly to Carol?
Use the following table to check that you have the correct description:

| Knot | Description |
|------|:-----------:|
| ![Two snakes](knot_snakes.png) | Two snakes fighting |
| ![Like you](knot_like_you.png) | Little bit like Carol |
| ![Mathematicl formula](knot_formula.png) | Mathematical formula |
| ![Cow's udder](knot_cow_udder.png) | Face like cow's udder |
| ![Headache belt](knot_headache.png) | Headache wearing a belt |
| ![Pole vaulter](knot_polevaulter.png) | Lazy pole vaulter |
| ![Cup of fingers](knot_fingercup.png) | Cup of fingers |

# I think I got that right
Good, this table will help you with the diagram:

Steal the banana
Tug on the piggy's tail
Poke the clown in the eye
Pull the finger
Make the baby play patty-cake
She loves me, she loves me not...
Make the boat go under the bridge
Pull apart the fighting snakes
Tickle the foot
Pull off the fly's wings
Make the water come out of the cup
Unravel the sweater
