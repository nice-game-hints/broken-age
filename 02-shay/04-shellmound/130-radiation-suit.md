Alex would need a radiation suit.

# Where to start?
Did you talk to Twyla, the Meriloft maiden that Mog refused? She is at Meriloft when you go down the ladder.

# Yes?
She would be willing to create the suit. She just needs the pattern and the material.

# Pattern?
A model of the final product.

# What?
Show her the baby radiation suit you have with you.

# Great, now the material
Didn't Alex say that the Dead Eye Druids robes were looking suspiciously like radiation shielding blast curtains?

# He did!
Go find the druids! They are at the peach tree. They've gone nuts with the peach. Talk to them. [Get their robes](100-robes.md)

# I got them!
Give them to Twyla.

# Feathers!
Um, yeah. Well, give it to Alex.
