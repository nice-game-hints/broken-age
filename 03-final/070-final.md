title: Final showdown
---

Multiple things should be in order to trigger the game end.

# Tell me
For Shay: You must have [the power on](050-power.md) and [Alex distracted](030-distract-alex.md).

For Vella: You must have [mother distracted](036-distract-mother.md) and the grabbing controls set to "MANUAL".

You might have to do this multiple times to make them be all set at the same time.

# Everything is in order
Shay should now enable Grabbing Gary from the deck. And Vella enables the death ray from the fake control room using the big window.
