title: Vella: Distract mother
---

Shay's mother is controlling the ships arms and setting them to centralized control.

# How to get her elsewhere?
She is having an argument with the Space Weaver.

# Yes?
Maybe if you could make the Space Weaver really malfunction somehow.

# How?
Like, tickling it. It's NavScarf is really sensitive.

# Tickling?
Use the hexipal for tickling.

# How?
Did Shay already [get pass the hexipal tribe](040-pass-hexipals.md)?

# He did!
Then you should have a wiring for a harp-playing/tickling hexipal.

# I do
Wire ^[You find an excess wire from Marekai's lair. On the computer.] Vella's hexipal to the same harp-playing wiring and put the hexipal in front of the NavScarf. You can now access the control room and press the red triangle button.
