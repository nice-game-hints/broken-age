Shay's mother has locked all the doors and is not letting you in. Maybe you could fool her.

# How?
First, you need to change your voice.

# I tried
Did you travel through a teleport already?

# No?
If you travel through a teleport ^[Talk to Marek first to activate the teleports. You find him from where Shay left him.] your head gets bigger and your voice lower.

# It is not big enough
Travel twice through the teleports. The direction should be towards the teleport central point both times. Your head should now got bigger **twice**.

# It is big
Go talk to Shay's mother. You can now fool her.

# Questions!
The first question is easy. Have you played [by Shay](/02-shay/04-shellmound/010-snake.md) already?

# I have
So, the answer is Mister Huggy.

# Next question!
Please, can we not do this?

# We have to!
No, that is the correct answer. Just like Shay always said.

# Oh, last question!
Now, you just have to guess what were Shay's [first space boots like](040-first-boots.md).
