title: First boots
---

Shay's mother is asking what Color, Size and Pattern were Shay's first space boots.

# So?
Have you visited the trophy room? There is all kinds of interesting information.

# What information
Look close. There are these items:
 - Note to shoe fairy ^[First he had Red/Striped and then Green/Skulls. After that he wanted Red/Skulls.]
 - Medical report ^[On age 6 his shoe size is +3 bigger than on age 5.]
 - Shoe sculpture ^[First boots at age 5. Dotted pattern.]
 - Teeth ^[Lost first teeth at age 6.]
 - Drawing ^[Age 8: Blue boots.]
 - Photo ^[Lost teeth. Show size is 7.]
 - Trophy ^[Purple boots.]

# Okay?
With that information you can come up what were his first boots like.

# So, size?
The medical report tells his shoe size was +3 when he was 6. He also lost first teeth at the age of 6. In the snake picture he has missing teeth and shoes of size 7.
So the size is: ^[4]

# Got it. Pattern?
The shoe sculpture shows it. They are his first shoes. So the pattern is ^[Dotted]

# And the color?
At the age of 8 he had ~~blue~~. ~~Red~~ ones were striped, not spotted. ~~Green~~ ones were with a skull pattern. Neither of these were his first (dotted) boots. At nine years he wanted machine made boots. So we have boots for ages 8, 7 and 6. He probably won the trophy at the age of 5 then. So the color is ^[Purple].

# Elementary!
It is, dear Watson. Go answer to Shay's mother. Here's the specs once more:
 - Color: purple
 - Size: 4
 - Pattern: polka-dot
