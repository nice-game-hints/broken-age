You have [the bomb](010-bomb.md) and now it needs to be ejected from the ship.

# Where?
There was the trash chute on the corridor, next to the teleporter.
It will eject everything put in there to space, err.. outside.

# It is locked
[Open it first](040-chute.md)

# It is open
Now just drop the bomb into the chute.
