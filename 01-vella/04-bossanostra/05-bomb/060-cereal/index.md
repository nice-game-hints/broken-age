Cereal is perfect breakfast.

# How to get it?
Check out [spilling the cereal multiple times](spilling.md)

# Okay, I can spill it
The hexibot will clean it and take it into the chute. You can follow it.

# I am too slow!
Can you hinder its movement somehow?

# How?
Move the debris back at the corridor. It will slow it a little.

# Still too slow
So, before you spill the cereal remember to put the debris in the way at the corridor, first.
Now, when you spill the cereal follow the hexibot. Hexibot will go through the corridor, you will use the teleport.
This way you should make it in time to chase it away and you get the cereal it drops.
