Space Weaver is broken and it needs yarn to work.

# Yarn?
By the way, have you [tried the runaway train mission](080-train.md) yet?

# I have
Well, then you have yarn ^[You should do the wave during the train mission.].

# I have yarn, yes
Give the yarn to Space Weaver.

# It is not spindled
That Space Weaver is quite picky. Could you use some kind of tool to make a spindle out of the yarn mess?

# Like?
Like the fork that has done that stuff with the spaghetti earlier ^[You can find the fork at the control room. There is a bowl on the counter.].

# Fork!
Use the fork on the yarn mess and then give that to Space Weaver.
