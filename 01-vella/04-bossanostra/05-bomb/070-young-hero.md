The creatures really miss their Young Hero!

# But Shay is in Shellmound
Maybe you could fake him.

# How?
Did you notice that the Shay-doll is still in his bed?

# It is!
Use the control sphere and the claw to lift the debris off the doll.

# Where did it took it?
In the kitchen. Walk there and grab it.

# He is too... flat.
Maybe you could fill him up.

# With what?
Go to the Ice Cream Avalance room ^[Use the control sphere to unlock it.] and fill him up with the whipped cream gun. The Young Hero is here!
