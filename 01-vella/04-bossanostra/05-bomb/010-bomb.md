A bomb is the perfect way to kill all the Mogs in the factory.

# How to build it?
What did have massive amount of energy in the ship?

# What?
The fusion orb of course. Go to the Fusion Orb Containment Facility using the middle teleport.

# I'm there
You can walk straight to the orb without any suits or such. Take it.

# It's too hot!
Maybe you could make a cooling container for it.

# Like?
Use the helmet and fill it with something cold.

# Cold?
Like [ice cream](050-icecream.md)!

# It is filled
Great! Now just use it to the orb and you have your bomb.
