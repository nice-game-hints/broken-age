There is a star chart in Marekai's lair. You can get there through Shay's bedroom.

# How to get it?
Could you get Marekai out of the lair and back to _his_ bedroom?

# How?
His bedroom can be accessed through the trophy room.

# I am there
There is a loose panel on the wall. If you fiddle with the wires it will cause an alarm.

# Marekai!
Now he is in his bedroom. Quick, grab the star chart!

# Couldn't make it
You have to push the green button to lock the door first. Now, grab the star chart.
