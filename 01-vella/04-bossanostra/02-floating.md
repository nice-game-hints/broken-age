Vella is floating in space.

# What to do?
Try to get into the hatch, of course.

# But how?
Have you tried to get the smaller arm catch you? It only catches Shay.

# How?
Use the helmet on it. You have to time it so when the arm is pointing you and you are facing the arm.

# I got it!
Neat! Now, try to grab one of the boots with the small arm. The right one is closer.

# Timing...
You have to time it so that you are facing the boot and the big claw is grabbing. Otherwise the thumb is in the way.

# I got that too!
Phew, now you have the boot attached to the arm.

# Next?
Now it should work with the big claw. Again, get your timing in order. You have to do it when the claw is open and you are facing the claw.

# Gotcha!
Fly to the vent.
