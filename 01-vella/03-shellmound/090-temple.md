The blind guardians are protecting the temple. Only the one who knows the answer to their riddle gets in.

# How was it, again?
    You always take us down 

    When we are in our prime. 

    Devour my sweet rewards 

    Yet I'll return in time. 

    A child of mine will rise 

    Out of his rotten bed. 

    Up from a hidden pit 

    Long after I am dead. 

# Little help?
_Take us down_ means harvesting. _child will rise_ from _rotten bed_ could mean a seed sprouting something new. And _sweet rewards_ means it is something sweet.

# Don't get it
It's [a peach](../02-meriloft/060-peach.md), of course. You can climb back to Meriloft from Curtis' house.

# I have a peach!
Give it to the guardians.
