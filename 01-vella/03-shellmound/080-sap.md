Did you get [the tree to talk](030-tree.md)?

# It is talking, all right
Nice. It will vomit some sap for you.

# Vomit?
Yeah, it really doesn't like what you humans do to them. If you show those things to it, it will vomit.

# What thing?
Ask [Curtis to make you a stool](040-stool.md). Show the stool to the tree.

# Vomit is all around
You should collect that vomit into something.

# Like what?
I would say [a bucket](070-bucket.md) is enough.

# I have the bucket
Go and attach it to the tree. Show the stool to it.
