This is it. You are in Shellmound and ready to kill Mog Chothra. You just need to create a powerful weapon.

# Where to start?
Have you visited [the temple](090-temple.md), yet?

# I have now
Did you [talk to the Dead Eye God](120-god.md)?

# The pyramid is...
A space station! Yes. Maybe there is a chance of building a weapon with it.

# What to do?
Have you clicked around the temple... I mean space station? Search for stuff and something to fix.

# The light stuff?
Yes, there are some interesting stuff at the altar

# What to do?
Take the upper one, the red Laser Coil. Also, take the bottom one, the amplifying quartz.

# Uh oh..
It broke, you would have to replace it.

# With what?
With another piece of glass, maybe ^[At Curtis' house there is a window upstairs. You can get glass from that.]

# I have the shard!
Great, you can fix it now. Put the glasses back.

# Fixed it!
Good, you put them in the right sockets and the scanning beam won't overheat. Think about it, overheated laser beam. Phew...

# Wait a minute...
Oh oh! You could use it as a weapon. Quick, put the red Laser Coil into the _bottom_ socket and the glass to the _upper_.
