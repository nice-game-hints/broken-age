title: Fix the broken machines
---

The air transport system is broken and the pipes are open.

# How to fix it?
Maybe you could find some pipe to fix it. There is some pipe on the right hangin from the chute.

# How to take it?
You would need the longer pipe but you can't cut it up there as you would fall.

# So?
Cut it where you _can_ reach. Use the knife ^[Knife can be found where you started. Talk to it.] while standing next to the pipe and you get a smaller pipe.

# Then what?
Use the small tube to combine the pipes. The computer will tell you what happens when you try the combinations.

# Hmm.. panels...
Yes, you can open up three panels by connecting the pipes.

# So what?
One of the panels would probably catch you if you fall from the top.

# Which of them?
Then panel 36.
