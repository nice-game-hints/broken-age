title: Escape Mog Chothra
---

It is a creepy beast. You better escape. Talk to the other girls.

# How?
I think the bird is your best option.

# How to attract it?
It is attracted to the yellow lady's drumstick. Maybe you could trade it.

# To what?
Talk to the blue lady. Trade your corset with her. Ask the bottle again.

# I have the bottle
Now, offer it to the yellow lady. I twill explode all over her.

# What now?
Give her the towel. She throws you the drumstick.

# The bird!
Throw your corset over its head and cut yourself loose with the knife. Off you go!
