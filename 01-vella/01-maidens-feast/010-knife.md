Your mother needs the knife for the cake.

# Where is it?
Did you look for it?

# I did!
I suspect it is Gramps! Talk to him.

# Hmm..
I think he would like a cupcake.

# Where?
There are cupcakes under the towel in the front? Grab one and give it to Gramps.

# He ate it...
Get another one. Ask to split it and grab the knife as he leaves it to the table.
Give the knife to your mother.
