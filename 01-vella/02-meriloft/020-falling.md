You will fall slowly if you are not carrying anything heavy. If you are carrying something heavy (for example a golden egg) you need equipment.

# What equipment
Cloudshoes!

# Where to get ones?
Go the ladder down to find the green girl. Talk to her and she will give you her cloudshoes. Use the cloudshoes on yourself and you can walk on clouds with heavy objects.
