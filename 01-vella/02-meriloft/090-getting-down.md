title: How to get down from the clouds?
---

Well, that is the question. Jumping results only in being _rescued_.

# Climbing?
Yes, you could use the big ladder that is used to access Lightbeard!

# How to get it down?
It is attached to the platform with the offering baskets.

# Go on
Put something heavy on the baskets

# Heavy?
The three golden eggs:
 - [Jessie is guarding one](030-jessies-egg.md)
 - [There is one next to the Hatchery](070-golden-egg.md)
 - [Did you talk to Lightbeard?](080-lightbeard.md)
