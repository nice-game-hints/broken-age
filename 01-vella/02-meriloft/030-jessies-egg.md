title: How to find Jessie's egg?
---

Jessie has lost her egg and is protecting the surrogate egg.
If you [find Gus](040-gus.md), you find Jessie's egg, too.

# He is grabby!
You would need to try to land _behind_ him.

# How?
Walk to the hole in the clouds that is right of the tree. A little up from the path. You need to talk to Gus first.

# Whoa
Now you can go back down and grab the egg. Give it to Jessie.
